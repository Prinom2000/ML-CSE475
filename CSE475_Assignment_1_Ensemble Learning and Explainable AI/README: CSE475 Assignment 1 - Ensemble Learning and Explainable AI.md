****Overview:****


This Jupyter Notebook is designed for the CSE475 course assignment focusing on Ensemble Learning and Explainable AI (XAI). It demonstrates the implementation and analysis of machine learning models, using ensemble techniques to improve predictive accuracy and applying explainability methods to interpret model decisions.

**Features**


1) Ensemble Learning Techniques:

-> Implementation of popular ensemble methods (e.g., Bagging, Boosting, Random Forests, etc.).

-> Evaluation of model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

2) Explainable AI (XAI):

-> Use of interpretability tools like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations).

-> Visualization of feature importance and decision-making processes.

3) Data Processing:

-> Preprocessing steps such as data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering.

4) Model Evaluation:

-> Comparative analysis of ensemble models.

-> Insights into model behavior using XAI techniques.

**File Structure**


-> Data Loading and Preprocessing: Initial steps to load datasets and prepare them for model training.

-> Model Training: Implementation of ensemble methods.

-> Explainability: XAI methods to interpret model outputs.

-> Evaluation and Conclusion: Discussion of results and findings.
